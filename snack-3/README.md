# Objects Snack

- The first thing to do is to create an objects array containing some racing bikes;
- Each bike will have the following information: name and weight;
- The purpose of this code is to console print the bike with the lesser weight using destructuring and a template literal;
- We can use the destructuring assignment into a `forEach` loop to save in a variable the values of the current index bike;
- Going on with the indexes, we can then compare each index with the previous one and save into the variable the one with the lesser weight;
- IF the current bike's weight is lesser than the previous one's, our variable gets reassigned;
- ELSE the variable remains the same.
