# Place Cards for a VIP Party

- The purpose of this code is to create the place cards for a table of a VIP party;
- First of all, we can create an array with the names of the guests;
- Using a `map` loop, we can then create a second array;
- This array transforms the first one in an objects array and then adds the remaining attributes: name of the table and place number.
