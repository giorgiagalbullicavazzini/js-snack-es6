# Objects Snack

- The first thing to do is to create an objects array containing some football teams;
- Each team will have the following information: name, scored points and suffered fouls;
- The name will be the only set property;
- Points and fouls will be set to 0;
- We can use the destructuring assignment into a `forEach` loop to save the values of points and fouls;
- Then, we can reassign them using the `Math.random` method;
- We can use another destructuring assignment into a loop to save the new values of the suffered fouls and the names of the teams and put them in a new array;
- Finally, we can console print the new array.
